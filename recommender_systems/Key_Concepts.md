## Experiment methods for evaluating the key metrics

### Offline experiment (contains several steps):
1. Obtain user behavoir data and 
2. Fit data into model and get predictions(results)
3. use offline metrics to evaluate results from different models
  
- pros:

Experiment with differnet algorithms and models quickly without involving actual users
Don't need support of acutal running system. Just user data is required
- cons:

Can't evaluate business metrics
offline metrics is different from business metrics (e.g. accuracy(offline) vs customer satisfation(business))
